# 3D Printer Simulation with Golang and OpenGL

Explore the world of 3D printing with this simulation written in Golang and powered by OpenGL. This project provides a visual representation of the 3D printing process, allowing you to interact with and understand the basics of 3D printing.

## Features

- Realistic simulation of the 3D printing process.
- Implemented in Golang for simplicity and efficiency.
- Graphics rendering with OpenGL for a visually immersive experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Golang installed on your machine. [Download Golang](https://golang.org/dl/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AlirezaNeGe/3DPrinter-Opengl.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 3DPrinter-Opengl
    ```

3. Run the simulation:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```



## Usage

You can use you own gcode file by passing it to command line arguments.
```bash
    go run main.go gcode.file
```
Experiment with different parameters like layer height and print speed to see how they affect the 3D printing process. Gain insights into the mechanics of 3D printing in a visually engaging environment.
